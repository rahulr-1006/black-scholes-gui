## 🧠 Implementation Details

This app is built with clarity and education in mind. Below is a breakdown of what’s implemented and what each part contributes to the overall Black-Scholes pricing tool.

---

### 📊 Real-Time Pricing with Sliders

The sidebar of the app provides intuitive sliders for core Black-Scholes parameters:

| Parameter | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `S` | Spot price — current price of the underlying asset |
| `K` | Strike price — the price agreed in the option contract |
| `T` | Time to expiration (in years) |
| `r` | Risk-free interest rate |
| `σ` | Volatility — the expected fluctuation of the asset’s price |

These values dynamically update the call and put prices every time they are changed, providing real-time output using:

```python
black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma)
black_scholes_put(S, K, T, r, sigma)
```

---

### 📈 Visualizing Option Behavior

The app includes three core visualizations:

1. **Payoff Diagram**  
   Shows how profit or loss changes depending on where the stock ends up at expiration.

2. **Sensitivity to Volatility**  
   Demonstrates how increasing or decreasing volatility affects the value of call and put options.

3. **Sensitivity to Time to Expiration**  
   Illustrates how time decay impacts option value, especially as expiration nears.

Each chart is generated using `matplotlib` and rendered in Streamlit with `st.pyplot()`.

### ⚙️ Greek Calculations

Greeks quantify how sensitive an option’s value is to different variables:

| Greek | Description | Formula |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Delta (Call)** | Sensitivity to stock price | \( \Delta = N(d_1) \) |
| **Delta (Put)** | Sensitivity to stock price | \( \Delta = N(d_1) - 1 \) |
| **Gamma** | Sensitivity of Delta to stock price | \( \Gamma = \frac{N'(d_1)}{S \cdot \sigma \cdot \sqrt{T}} \) |
| **Vega** | Sensitivity to volatility | \( \text{Vega} = S \cdot N'(d_1) \cdot \sqrt{T} \) |
| **Theta (Call)** | Time decay | \( \Theta = \frac{-S \cdot N'(d_1) \cdot \sigma}{2\sqrt{T}} - rK e^{-rT} N(d_2) \) |
| **Theta (Put)** | Time decay | \( \Theta = \frac{-S \cdot N'(d_1) \cdot \sigma}{2\sqrt{T}} + rK e^{-rT} N(-d_2) \) |

These are computed in `bs_pricing.py` using NumPy and SciPy for normal distribution evaluations.

### 🧪 Educational Use Case

This app is designed as a **learning sandbox** for:

- Finance students trying to understand option pricing
- Interview prep for quant/dev roles
- Visual intuition for how Black-Scholes works
- Exploring how the Greeks behave near-the-money or close to expiration

  
## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📘 Formulae

**Call Option Price:**

$$
C = S \cdot N(d_1) - K \cdot e^{-rT} \cdot N(d_2)
$$

**Put Option Price:**

$$
P = K \cdot e^{-rT} \cdot N(-d_2) - S \cdot N(-d_1)
$$

Let me know if you want to add:

- A “📌 TODO” section for future improvements
- A deployment section (Heroku / HuggingFace / Streamlit Cloud)
- Or a math appendix with derivations and assumptions

Would you like to add a roadmap or keep it simple for now?
